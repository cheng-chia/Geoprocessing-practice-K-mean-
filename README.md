# K-Means Clustering


#### This is a programming practice to write a geoprocessing tool based on the pseudocode. The K-Means tool is a popular clustering method for data mining. When we have spatial data with coordinates like (X,Y) or (X,Y,Z), K-Means is a good tool for grouping them.  


## The concept of K-Means listed below:

  #### 1. Pick random Kpoints from point distribution
  #### 2. Calculate distances between each point to randomly picked Kpoints
  #### 3. Assign Cluster ID of the closest to all points
  #### 4. Calculate centroid coordinates of clusters
  #### 5. Repeat 2 â€“4, and stop when cluster members are stabilized

##### *The distance used here is Euclidean Distance
